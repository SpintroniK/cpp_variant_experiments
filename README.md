# C++ Variant Experiments

Attempts to make a variant visitor for trees.

## Rose Tree - Composable C++

The first experiment is based on Ben Deane's talk at CppCon 2021: 
[Composable C++: Principles and Patterns - Ben Deane - CppCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-IuTLrwpuU)

A little had to be used to make it compile with GCC 10.

The C++ file for that experiment is `rose_tree.cpp`.
